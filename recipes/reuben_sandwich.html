        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. 
            The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.
            A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li> 
            <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li> 
            <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>

                1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese.
                Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter.
